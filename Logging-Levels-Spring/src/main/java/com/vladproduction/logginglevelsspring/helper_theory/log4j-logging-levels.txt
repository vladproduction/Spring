The logging levels are used to control the amount and type of information added to the log statements.

*ALL
used to turn on all levels of logging. Once this is configured, other levels are not considered at all, including custom levels.

*TRACE
was introduced in version 1.2 and adds even more information to debug level logs.
At this level, the amount of logs generated can be overwhelming so be careful.

*DEBUG
is used to log the fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
This level is turned off in the production environment, until it needs to be turned on to debug critical production
issues that are not reproducible in the development environment.

*INFO
is the most used level in production and logs informational messages that highlight the progress of the application
at coarse-grained level.
In real-time, system administrators watch the info logs to ensure whatâ€™s happening on the system right now,
and if there is any problem everything is alright in the system.

*WARN
suggests that the application might be continued, but we should take extra caution.
Generally, the applications can tolerate warning messages, but they should always be justified and examined.

*ERROR
shouts at us that something had gone terribly wrong, and we must investigate immediately. It simply means that the application
has met really undesired state. For example database unavailability, or unexpected formatted input etc.

*FATAL
signals very bad news the ERROR, even the application crash.

*OFF
Simple enough. NO LOGGING !!!
