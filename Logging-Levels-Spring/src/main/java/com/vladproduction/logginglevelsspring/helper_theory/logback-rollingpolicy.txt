The property logging.logback.rollingpolicy.clean-history-on-start=true is used in conjunction with Logback,
a popular logging framework for Java applications.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:
*logging.logback.rollingpolicy: This part specifies that the property is related to Logback's rolling policy configuration.
*rollingpolicy: A rolling policy determines how log files are managed when they reach a certain size or age. It can trigger
actions like creating a new log file, compressing old ones, or deleting them.
*clean-history-on-start: This specific property instructs the rolling policy to delete existing archived log files when the
application starts.
*=true: Sets the clean-history-on-start property to true, enabling the deletion of archived logs on startup.

In simpler terms, with this property set to true, whenever your application starts, Logback will automatically remove any
previously archived log files associated with the rolling policy. This can be useful for:
-Starting fresh: Ensures you begin with a clean log set for each application run.
-Disk space management: Helps prevent log files from accumulating and consuming excessive storage space.

Things to keep in mind:
This property only works with rolling policies that support archive deletion.
Ensure you have a backup strategy in place if you need to access historical logs.
