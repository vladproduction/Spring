Simple example of a regular expression (regex) that matches the email pattern with the following
requirements:

The regex would be:
@Pattern(regexp = "^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@[A-Za-z0-9-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}$")

Explanation of the regex:

1) "^" and "$" signify the beginning and end of the string respectively;
2) [A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+ : Matches one or more uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, plus sign,
    underscore, period, or hyphen for the username part before the "@" symbol;
3) @ as it is;
4) [A-Za-z0-9-]+ : Matches one or more uppercase or lowercase letters, digits, or hyphen for the main domain;
5) \\.: Matches the period (.) before the domain extension;
6) [A-Za-z]{2,6}: Matches the domain extension, which must be two to six uppercase or lowercase letters;

Overall, this regex pattern ensures that the email address contains one or more characters
before and after the "@" symbol, followed by a valid domain name.
Using this regex pattern, the variable email will only accept values that match a valid
email address format.
