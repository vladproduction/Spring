Simple example of a regular expression (regex) that matches a password pattern with the following
requirements:

The password must be at least 8 characters long.
It must contain at least one uppercase letter.
It must contain at least one lowercase letter.
It must contain at least one digit.
The regex would be: "^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d).{8,}$"

break it down:

The "^" and "$" symbols represent the beginning and end of the string, respectively.
"?=.*[a-z]" ensures that there is at least one lowercase letter in the password.
"?=.*[A-Z]" ensures that there is at least one uppercase letter in the password.
"?=.*\\d" ensures that there is at least one digit in the password.
".{8,}" ensures that the password is at least 8 characters long.
By using this regex pattern, the password field will only accept values that meet the specified criteria.
