-#- ACID is a concept typically associated with database management systems (DBMS) to ensure data
    integrity during transactions.

ACID Properties:

-Atomicity:
An entire transaction is treated as a single unit. Either all operations succeed (commit), or none do (rollback).

-Consistency:
Ensures the data transitions from one valid state to another, adhering to pre-defined business rules.

-Isolation:
Transactions from different users or processes are isolated from each other, preventing conflicts or seeing
partially completed changes.

-Durability:
Once a transaction commits, the changes are persisted permanently, even in case of system failures.
