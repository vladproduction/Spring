ACID in Java Applications:

Java applications interact with databases to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
To achieve ACID guarantees, developers rely on the underlying DBMS features:
-1-JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API:
Provides methods for interacting with databases but doesn't enforce ACID itself.
-2-Transactions in DBMS: Developers initiate transactions using the specific database's mechanisms
(e.g., SQL statements like BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK). The DBMS manages the ACID properties.

Some Frameworks and techniques:

-#- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate or JPA can simplify transaction management by
    abstracting the underlying database interactions.

-#- Java Transaction API (JTA): Provides a standardized way to manage transactions across multiple resources,
    including databases.
